I began working on Isoputt in December 2019 when I was inspired by [KennyNL's Minigolf](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/minigolf-kit) asset pack. I thought that I could use these tiles to make a simple game in a week. I placed some of Kenny's tiles into the scene, and started trying to get the ball physics right.

_My initial physics-prototyping level._

5 months later and I'm still working on the same project. Turns out designing compelling content is hard.

The experience of making this game has changed my outlook on game dev completely. I now view level creation as the primary mode of game development; where systems and implementations merely serve as a scaffold upon which to build artistry.

_After much iteration..._


After much iteration, I began to form an effective design process. I begin by placing 2 or 3 large cubes, put the ball on one and the hole on another, and start visualizing the path I want to force players to take. The placement of these initial large cubes is vitally important. Placed well, and the level will come together quickly and easily. Placed poorly, and you will fight to make the level fun.

_Less is more_

Simplicity is the key here. Less is more. I've spent countless hours adding more and more things to a bad level trying to make it fun, but it feels so impossible when you have a bad foundation. The good stuff forms when I have a good basis, and then I start removing the shots that I do not want to allow players to make. Finally, I focus on esthetics, adding small details in order to spice up the look of the game.
