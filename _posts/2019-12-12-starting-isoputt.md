I began working on Isoputt in December 2019 when I was inspired by [KennyNL's Minigolf](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/minigolf-kit) asset pack. I thought that I could use these tiles to make a simple game in a week. I placed some of Kenny's tiles into the godot editor, and started trying to get the ball physics right. I started with a simple rigid body sphere. 5 months later and I'm still working on the same project.

_My initial physics-prototyping level._

Turns out designing compelling content is hard.

The experience of making this game has changed my outlook on game dev completely. I now view level creation as the primary mode of game development; where systems and implementations merely serve as a scaffold upon which to build artistry. Before, I was stuck in the programmer focused mindset, constantly trying to create some perfect system which would generate fun. I now see game design differently; I'm trying to create a system where a single hour of my time can generate 5 minutes of entertainment for thousands of people. That's the equation. Thats the goal.

Turns out fun is elusive. I had many failed level designs. After making the following level, I deleted all the levels I had made with KennyNL's tiles, and started from scratch. I had moved the bar higher, and none of my previous levels reached the threshold of quality that I now required.

_After much iteration_


This is what growth is. Deleting the old and starting again. After much more iteration, I began to form an effective design process. Now, I usually have a clear vision in mind before I begin. I have a notebook where I draw the simplest minigolf levels imaginable, and I slowly add complexity to the simplicity. Ideally, this allows me to fail on paper, instead of at my computer.

_Less is more_

Simplicity is the key here. Less is more. I've spent countless hours adding more and more things to a bad level trying to make it fun, but it feels so impossible when you have a bad foundation. The good stuff forms when I have a good basis, and then I start removing the shots that I do not want to allow players to make. Finally, I focus on esthetics, adding small details in order to spice up the look of the game.

_Details come last_

My basic formula is this: 5 shots for a beginner player, 3 for an intermediate and 2 for an expert. Once I have a level that requires approximately that amount of shots, I iterate on the look of it. I'm still developing my esthetic style. But I have [lots][odpom] of [inspiration][sir_carma] on twitter.
