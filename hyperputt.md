HyperPutt aims to be a zen puzzler. I'm working hard to make the levels interesting and challenging. I hope to release HyperPutt in mid 2019 on Steam, Google Play and the iOS App Store.

Progress has been slow but steady. I'm focusing on trying to create scenes that will immediately capture attention. It takes time to iterate on every piece. I know I have a long way to go.
