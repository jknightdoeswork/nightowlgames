HyperPutt is an elegant golf puzzle game being developed in the Godot Engine.

_My first level, December 4th, 2019_

HyperPutt aims to be a zen puzzler. I'm working hard to make the levels interesting and challenging. I hope to release HyperPutt in mid 2019 on Steam, Google Play and the iOS App Store.

Progress has been slow but steady. I'm focusing on trying to create scenes that will immediately capture attention. It takes time to iterate on every piece. I know I have a long way to go.

_Another few hours of iteration on the water, December 12th, 2019_

I spent a few hours experimenting with different values on the water and waterfalls. These are much more performant values (I shrank the noise textures). I think the water looks pretty good, but I think the waterfall could use some improvement still. I also changed the direction of the light, just as an experiment.
