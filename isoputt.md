_Note: this game is in development._

IsoPutt is an elegant golf puzzle game being developed in the Godot Engine.

_One of the early iterations, December 4th, 2019._

IsoPutt aims to be a zen puzzler. I'm currently working on making the levels interesting and challenging.

_Simplicity hides subtle shortcuts._

![twins][twins]
_Minimal level design._

![twisted][twisted]
_The perfect shot preview allows long, complicated shots to be made._

In addition to hand crafted levels, I'm working on an algorithm to generate an infinite number of minigolf levels.

_Procedural generation used to create infinite levels._
